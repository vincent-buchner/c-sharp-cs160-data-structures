# CS160 Algorithms in <u>C#</u>

<i>While getting acquainted with C#, I implemented several basic data structures taught in an introductory data structure course.</i>

### Introduction

In the CS160 course, I had the chance to delve into Python by implementing different data structures commonly used in algorithms. This article gives an overview of the data structures they explored and implemented during their learning journey, but instead in C#. By gaining hands-on experience with these fundamental data structures, I was able to enhance their understanding of C# and its applications in algorithmic problem-solving.

## Data Structures

We will be implementing the following data structures:

### Stacks, Queues, and Deques

Stacks, queues, and deques are fundamental data structures that allow for efficient storage and retrieval of elements in a specific order. I implemented these structures in C#, understanding their underlying principles and the associated methods for performing operations such as push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue.

### Doubly and Singly Linked List

Linked lists provide a dynamic way of storing and manipulating data elements. I implemented both doubly and singly linked lists in C#, exploring how to traverse the list, insert and delete nodes, and perform other essential operations efficiently.

### Hash Tables

Hash tables are widely used for efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval. I gained insights into the inner workings of hash tables and implemented one using separate chaining as the collision resolution strategy. They learned how to handle collisions and maintain a balanced hash table for optimal performance.

### Lambda Functions and Recursion

Lambda functions and recursion are powerful concepts in C# that contribute to elegant and efficient algorithm design. I explored the use of lambda functions for concise code implementation and recursion for solving problems that can be divided into smaller subproblems.

### K-ary Trees

K-ary trees are hierarchical data structures with nodes having a maximum of k children. I implemented k-ary trees in C#, learning how to traverse the tree, insert and delete nodes, and perform other common operations. They also gained insights into the different applications of k-ary trees in algorithms.

### Graphs

Graphs are versatile data structures used to represent relationships between entities. I implemented graph structures in C#, understanding different graph representations (e.g., adjacency matrix, adjacency list) and common graph algorithms such as breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS).

## Conclusion

Through the Luther College CS160 course and their implementation of various data structures in C#, I have gained valuable insights into the world of algorithms and data manipulation. By building these fundamental structures from scratch, they deepened their understanding of C# and its applications in solving complex problems. This hands-on experience provided a solid foundation for their future endeavors in algorithm design and programming.
